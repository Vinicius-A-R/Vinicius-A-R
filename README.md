Hi, I'm learning about programming language from College, there I learned how to program in the classrooms of
Algorithms and Data Structure and Computer Architecture some languages like JAVA 8 and C. However, I locked the College
enrolment because of problems with my health, then I stopped my studies for almost 2 years. But in this year 2020 I went
back to study by my self programming language focused in JS, React, Redux and NodeJS because has a lot of opportunities for to work,
and I also like a little bit to develop my personal projects.

In my repositories you can see some of my projects and studies in React, Redux and NodeJS for now. I participated in some bootcamps of Incodde and IGTI,
